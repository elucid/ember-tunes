Ember Tunes: An ember.js demo
==================================

- Displays a list of available albums and their tracks
- Allows queueing albums for playback
- Plays the queue, one track at a time

USAGE
=====

Run:

    rake server

Visit the webserver at:

    http://localhost:9292


Background
==========

This app is a port of the application developed in the PeepCode Backbone screencasts https://peepcode.com/products/backbone-js and https://peepcode.com/products/backbone-ii

It was assembled for a demo talk I gave at Toronto.rb on August 14, 2012. The code starts off at the final application developed in the second screencast. There are a few initial commits for cleanup and toolchain updates. Then, there are a series of numbered commits. These are intended to show a gradual approach to assembling the app. Each commit focuses on a fairly small bit of functionality and tries to limit the number of new concepts introduced. New features are often stubbed in or implemented na√Øvely and are gradually refined and improved upon in later commits.


Ember Best Practices(?)
=======================

The final app is intended to showcase current Ember best practices. If you disagree with something I did or have improvements to suggest, please send a PR.


Pending
=======

I will be adding more comments shortly. In particular, comments that explain the motivation behind various changes rather than implementation details per se.


Thanks
======

Big shout out to @heycarsten and @trek for all of the great feedback and suggestions they provided on this code. Thanks also to Toronto.rb for having me present.
